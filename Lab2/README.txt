This program takes 3 arguments. 2 Directories and 1 filename. The directories must be at the same level of the c script.
For the arguments, the first argument is the source directory. This is the argument that will be used to see if a file needs to be 
replicated on the other directory, or if it should be deleted from the other directory. This is "a" on the lab instructions.
The next argument, the destination directory is the one referred to as "b" in the lab instructions. The last argument is the name of the file
to check for in the directories. If it doesn't exist on the source one, it is deleted from the destination.
