fd2 = 4

when initializing fd1, and fd2, we are opening the descriptors 1 and 2. Since fd0 is open on entry, when calling open(), we open
descriptor 3. The second time we call open on fd2, we are opening the descriptor 4. When we call close fd2, we are closing descriptor 4.
The last call to open, opens the descriptor 4, so when we print fd2, we get 4.
